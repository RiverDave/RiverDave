## 🔧 Major Contributions
- 🛠 [ClangIR](https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pulls?q=is%3Aopen%2Cclosed+is%3Apr+author%3ARiverDave+) - Actively contributing to platform-specific code generation (I've mainly contributed to X86, AArch64, CUDA) and intrinsic lowering for ClangIR, aiming to transform the way Clang lowers C++ to LLVM IR.
- 🐉 [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+author%3ARiverDave+label%3AClangIR) - Upstreaming ClangIR into LLVM, a next-generation IR that redefines how C++ and modern languages are lowered to LLVM IR — shaping the future of compiler infrastructure and developer tooling.
- 🌐 [Clang-Tidy](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ARiverDave+is%3Aclosed) –  Contributed and helped improve modern diagnostics for better C++ developer tooling.
- 🦀 [Naga/WGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/8432) – Contributing to some minor GPU backend patches on codegen and shader translation infrastructure for Naga.
- 👻 [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ARiverDave) - In progress (GPU stuff TBD)

Interested in platform specific code generation. Upstreaming Compiler Infrastructure Across LLVM & MLIR Ecosystems.
